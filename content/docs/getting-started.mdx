# Getting started

This walkthrough takes you from an empty directory to a running Selium service.

## Install the CLI

```bash
curl -fsSL https://selium.dev/install.sh | sh
selium --version
```

## Create a service

```bash
selium init hello-selium
cd hello-selium
```

Your project includes a manifest, a Rust entrypoint, and a test payload.

## Run locally

```bash
selium dev
```

## Deploy

```bash
selium deploy
selium logs --tail
```

If deployment fails, verify your credentials and confirm that your manifest values are valid for the target region.
