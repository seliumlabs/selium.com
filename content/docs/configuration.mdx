# Configuration

Selium uses a declarative manifest to define how a service runs inside the fabric.

## Example manifest

```toml
[service]
name = "hello-selium"
runtime = "wasm32-wasi"
entrypoint = "target/wasm32-wasi/release/hello.wasm"

[resources]
memory = "256Mi"
concurrency = 64

[deployment]
region = "iad"
min_replicas = 1
max_replicas = 10
```

## Common fields

- `service.name` sets the friendly identifier displayed in the console.
- `service.runtime` chooses the execution target and ABI.
- `resources.memory` caps runtime memory for each instance.
- `deployment.region` selects the primary region for cold starts.
