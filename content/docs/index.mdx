Selium is a hypervisor for WebAssembly. Guests are WASM services, all I/O is via channels, and every side-effect is gated by explicit capabilities. Public wires use Flatbuffers, so type guarantees survive process boundaries.

Selium is in alpha, so expect APIs and packaging to move a bit.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Install the runtime and system modules
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://selium.com/install.sh | sh

# Prepare a work directory
mkdir -p selium-work/{certs,modules}

# Generate local TLS certs
selium-runtime generate-certs --output-dir selium-work/certs

# Start a runtime with the remote client, switchboard, and atlas modules
selium-runtime --work-dir selium-work \
  --module 'path=modules/selium_remote_client_server.wasm;capabilities=ChannelLifecycle,ChannelReader,ChannelWriter,ProcessLifecycle,NetQuicBind,NetQuicAccept,NetQuicRead,NetQuicWrite;args=utf8:localhost,u16:7000' \
  --module 'path=modules/selium_switchboard_server.wasm;capabilities=ChannelLifecycle,ChannelReader,ChannelWriter,SingletonRegistry' \
  --module 'path=modules/selium_atlas_server.wasm;capabilities=ChannelLifecycle,ChannelReader,ChannelWriter,SingletonRegistry'
```

Once the runtime is up, start a process with the `selium` CLI (the remote client):

```bash
selium --cert-dir selium-work/certs \
  start hello.wasm start \
  --capabilities ChannelLifecycle,ChannelReader,ChannelWriter \
  --attach
```

## Core ideas

- Channels are the only I/O primitive, backed by a ring buffer and explicit backpressure.
- Capabilities are required for every host call; there is no ambient authority.
- Flatbuffers are used on public wires; internal data can stay idiomatic.
- The runtime loads WASM modules from a work directory and wires them by capabilities.

## What to read next

- Get from zero to running in Getting started.
- Learn how entrypoints, arguments, and capabilities work in Applications.
- Understand the runtime flags and module specs in Runtime.
- Dive into Channels to reason about backpressure and sharing.
