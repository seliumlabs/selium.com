# Selium documentation

Selium is a channel-native compute fabric for WASM services. These docs focus on installing the CLI, defining a service, and shipping it to the fabric.

## Quickstart

```bash
curl -fsSL https://selium.dev/install.sh | sh
selium login
selium init my-first-service
selium deploy
```

## Minimal service

```rust
use selium::runtime::Handler;

#[selium::service]
async fn handle(req: Request) -> Response {
    Response::text("hello from selium")
}
```

## What to read next

- Get from zero to a deployed service in Getting started.
- Learn how the runtime is configured in Configuration.
