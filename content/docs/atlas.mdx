| selium-atlas-protocol | Internal library that defines the client-server protocol | [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/selium-atlas-protocol/latest/selium_atlas_protocol/) |

Atlas is Selium's directory service. It lets application processes find external resources using stable names (`sel://` URIs) instead of passing around hardcoded handles.

A typical application URI looks like:

```
sel://tenant/app.app/process:entrypoint
```

**Note that this format is still being worked out, so some variance is expected.**

## Usage

The Atlas server registers itself as a singleton (`selium.atlas.singleton`). Processes can easily obtain a handle to the Atlas via the [global `Context`](applications#singletons).

To start the server module:

```bash
selium-runtime --module 'path=modules/selium_atlas_server.wasm;capabilities=ChannelLifecycle,ChannelReader,ChannelWriter,SingletonRegistry'
```

## Basic operations

At its core, Atlas is a small key/value directory with a few convenience queries:

- `get(uri)` -> `Option<AtlasId>`
- `insert(uri, id)`
- `remove(uri)`
- `lookup(pattern)` -> `Vec<AtlasId>`

`lookup` uses prefix matching, so a broad pattern like `sel://tenant/app` can match `sel://tenant/app` as well as `sel://tenant/app/ep1/prod/chan` etc.

## `switchboard` feature

The Atlas client ships with the `switchboard` feature (enabled by default) that adds helpers to wire matches into the switchboard:

- `PublisherAtlasExt::matching`
- `SubscriberAtlasExt::connect`
- `ServerAtlasExt::accept`

It lets you discover endpoints by URI and immediately connect them without manual channel plumbing.

## Log Registrar

Selium provides a log channel registrar hook, which the Atlas uses to facilitate registering a process's log channel via [`--log-uri`](applications#logging). If Atlas server is not loaded, this is simply a _noop_.
