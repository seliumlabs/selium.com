description: "Discover applications and channels."

Atlas is Selium's directory service. It lets services find each other by stable names (`sel://` URIs) instead of passing around hardcoded handles.

A typical URI looks like:

```
sel://tenant/app.app/service:ep
```

Atlas is registered as a singleton (`selium.atlas.singleton`), so guests resolve it via `Context::singleton::<Atlas>()` or `Context::require::<Atlas>()`.

To start the server module:

```bash
selium-runtime --work-dir selium-work \
  --module 'path=modules/selium_atlas_server.wasm;capabilities=ChannelLifecycle,ChannelReader,ChannelWriter,SingletonRegistry'
```

## Basic operations

At its core, Atlas is a small key/value directory with a few convenience queries:

- `get(uri)` -> `Option<AtlasId>`
- `insert(uri, id)`
- `remove(uri)`
- `lookup(pattern)` -> `Vec<AtlasId>`

`lookup` uses URI containment rules, so a broad pattern like `sel://tenant/app` can match multiple services underneath it.

## `switchboard` feature

The `selium-atlas` crate ships with a `switchboard` feature (enabled by default) that adds helpers to wire matches into the switchboard:

- `PublisherAtlasExt::matching`
- `SubscriberAtlasExt::connect`
- `ServerAtlasExt::accept`

It lets you discover endpoints by URI and immediately connect them without manual channel plumbing.

Atlas also provides a log URI registrar (`install_log_uri_registrar`) used by the userland logging bridge when a log URI is supplied.
