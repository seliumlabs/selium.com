The remote client module is Selium's "outside-in" control plane. It exposes a QUIC endpoint that lets you start/stop processes and interact with channels from outside the runtime. The `selium` CLI is just a client for this module.

To start the server module:

```bash
selium-runtime --work-dir selium-work \
  --module 'path=modules/selium_remote_client_server.wasm;capabilities=ChannelLifecycle,ChannelReader,ChannelWriter,ProcessLifecycle,NetQuicBind,NetQuicAccept,NetQuicRead,NetQuicWrite;args=utf8:localhost,u16:7000'
```

The `args` are the bind domain and port for the control plane (where the CLI will connect).

## CLI basics

The CLI binary is named `selium`:

```bash
# Start a process
selium --cert-dir selium-work/certs \
  start hello.wasm start \
  --capabilities ChannelLifecycle,ChannelReader,ChannelWriter \
  --attach

# Stop a process
selium --cert-dir selium-work/certs stop <id>
```

Environment variables:

- `SELIUM_DOMAIN` and `SELIUM_PORT` pick the control-plane endpoint
- `SELIUM_CERT_DIR` points to the TLS cert directory
- `SELIUM_LOG_FORMAT` switches between text and JSON

Note: `selium ps` is currently stubbed.

## Capabilities

The remote client will only request the capabilities you pass in. For example, `ProcessLifecycle` is required to spawn processes, and `NetHttp*` is required for HTTP I/O inside those processes. Treat this list as your "permission boundary" and keep it tight.
