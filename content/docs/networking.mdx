Networking in Selium is capability-driven. Guests access the host network stack through `selium_userland::net`, but only when you grant the relevant `Net*` capabilities. The goal is to make network I/O feel straightforward without smuggling in hidden authority.

Supported protocols:

- `NetProtocol::Quic` (QUIC over UDP with TLS 1.3)
- `NetProtocol::Http` (HTTP/1.1 over TCP)
- `NetProtocol::Https` (HTTP/2 over TLS 1.3)

TLS configuration is explicit. You register configs with `TlsServerConfig::register` and `TlsClientConfig::register` (gated by `NetTlsServerConfig` and `NetTlsClientConfig`).

Selium is still early here. Expect improvements and higher-level helpers over time.

## HTTP payloads

HTTP connections surface complete request/response payloads as raw bytes. When you read or write frames, you are responsible for parsing or formatting HTTP messages yourself. (Chunked transfer encoding is not supported yet.)

## Channels

Network connections are not channels, but they intentionally feel similar: they behave like `Stream`/`Sink` pairs. If you want to integrate them into your channel-based architecture, you can bridge explicitly:

- read frames from a `Connection` and publish to a channel
- subscribe to a channel and write frames to a `Connection`

This keeps the network layer explicit and avoids any hidden cross-talk between services.
