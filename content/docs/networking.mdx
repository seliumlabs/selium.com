Networking in Selium is capability-driven and exposed through `selium_userland::net`. You get bidirectional connections backed by the host stack while keeping explicit authority boundaries.

Supported protocols:

- `NetProtocol::Quic` (QUIC over UDP with TLS 1.3)
- `NetProtocol::Http` (HTTP/1.1 over TCP)
- `NetProtocol::Https` (HTTP/2 over TLS 1.3)

TLS configuration is explicit: use `TlsServerConfig::register` and `TlsClientConfig::register`, gated by `NetTlsServerConfig` and `NetTlsClientConfig` capabilities.

Selium is still early here. Expect improvements and higher-level helpers over time.

## HTTP payloads

HTTP connections surface complete request/response payloads as raw bytes. You are responsible for parsing or formatting HTTP messages when reading or writing frames. Chunked transfer encoding is not supported yet.

## Channels

Network connections are not channels, but they behave like `Stream`/`Sink` pairs. You can bridge them yourself:

- read frames from a `Connection` and publish to a channel
- subscribe to a channel and write frames to a `Connection`

This keeps the network layer explicit and avoids any hidden cross-talk between services.
